So she decided to leave her place of employment to concentrate on writing.

“You’re not getting any younger,” She said to herself.
From January to the following October, she wrote. And THEN she went to a workshop to try and figure out how to get it published.
Richard Paul Evans is the expert in all things written, and so she decided to listen to him.
She heard heartfelt tales, of what, and what not to do. And then she listened to this.
“Write your book, and then read it to yourself at least eight times. If you still enjoy reading it after the eighth time, it might be worth publishing.” -RPE
MIGHT be Worth Publishing? OH DEAR!
For many, this might be the end, but not for her.
If you tell her it can’t be done, I’m pretty sure that She’s going to do it, to prove she can.
So she continued to write and read, and edit, and read, and read, and edit, and…
One day she signed papers approving the final copy and cover of her work.
She received an email that it would be ten days to 2 weeks before her book would go to production.
To her surprise, the very next day she found it offered, print on demand at Amazon.com.

While serving as an activity director for assisted living, I was privileged to associate with some very precious souls.

I recorded this experience because it was dear to my heart. I hope that it touches yours as well.

Margaret made quilts and always had one set up in the living room area of the community. She was an expert at this craft and rarely shared her space with others unless they could demonstrate an acceptable skill. This caused a bit of a rift among the ladies, but Margaret was always quick to mend her offense.

Sometimes, the other residents would pick on Margaret. Like chickens picking at the sores of the weakest fowl, until the dreadful end.

I don’t know if they were jealous of her, or afraid of the truth that their fates were condemned to follow a similar path. It seems that human nature will always shun the thing that reflects the mirror of our soul.

Margaret had suffered numerous health concerns that caused cognitive disruptions and frustrations. One day when her mind was clear, she said to me.

“My mind is going, my eyesights going, my hearing is nearly gone, and you are like the spark plug that puts the life back into me. I make quilts, but what you do is wrap people up and give them love. I don’t want to embarrass you” She said, “But I want you to know that you are a gift from God.”

Every time I read this I cry tears of joy. The truth is that we are all gifts from God.

Margaret had a way of finding the best in everyone and then enhancing it with her love.  

I believe that the world would do well to follow Margaret’s example of unconditional love and acceptance. I am better for having known her.

I hope that there are Margarets in your life and that they make you cry. They will be the inspiration you need to wrap people up and give them love.

Remember to look for the best in others; after all,  Margaret will always see the best in you.', null);

She was an amazing woman!
Born in 1916, she outlived multiple wars, catastrophes, trials, and temptations.
She remained stalwart to her faith, unwavering in her testimony of her Savior Jesus Christ.
I was surprised to see balloons at the entrance of the church, which also lined the hallway and floated near her casket in the viewing room. Amid the beautiful flowers and mourners, they brought a cheerful grace to the graduation ceremony of a daughter of God.
Roberta loved flowers. Evelyn hated them!
Sisters by birth, neither married, they were the staple of my youth — iconic figures of undying service and constant devotion to their family and their community.
They were surrogate mothers and grandmothers to many, loving the Egberts most of all.
Lisa and her family cared for them in their twilight years, even though their earthly pedigrees were art least once or twice removed.
Roberta served as the ward organist from 1941-2001. For over sixty years she brought music to the worship services of her God. It seemed to me that Roberta was eternal. She was the staple of every worship service, never shirking or neglecting her call. She can hold that title for the ages.
Maridean’s daughter Cheryl sang “Edelweiss” with a good friend Layne. Cheryl could barely contain her emotions at the start of the song, which she was to take the lead. Layne wrapped his arms around her and steadied her with compassion as he sang her part until she could compose herself. The room filled with beautiful music as the spirit of God filled the room.
Lest you think life is perfect, devoted sisters can also fight. It seems that one day not too long ago, Evelyn got on Roberta’s last nerve. Roberta picked up a pillow and threw it across the room and said: “The worst day of my life was when Evelyn was born.” (pretty funny if you consider she was at least 100 years old at the time of throwing)
When Roberta was eight years older, she suddenly had to share her parent’s undivided attention. We can all relate to this in one way or another.
Then with tears in her eyes, she immediately repented, “What would I have done without her all of these years? Roberta said “My life would have been so lonely without her.”
Although they grated one another’s nerves, they were a devoted team.
Every year at the Herriman cemetery you will see a full-sized flag flying in honor of every Veteran who lay in repose. The tribute, first offered by Evelyn and Roberta.
For years, the devoted and patriotic sisters would purchase and hand place a small flag at every Veterans grave.
Together they captured memories through the lens of Evelyn’s camera. Present at nearly every community event, they amassed a pictoral treasure that is beyond compare.
When I think of Roberta, I think of Evelyn. Even though they were very different people, they were one in purpose and their devotion to God.
I know that they have touched many lives with goodness, and I am honored to call them my friends.', null);

I took this picture almost 3 years ago.  We had some extreme losses and trials in our life.
It was early in the day and the branches were covered with a sheen of ice.
It wasn’t until I reviewed the picture that I discovered the rainbows dancing about.
For me, it was a beautiful reminder that God is in the details of our life. He understands
our greatest sorrows and He desires to bless us, sending light in our darkest hours.
I testify that He lives and His promises are sure.

insert into posts(title, content, img) values('November 15, 2019', 'Uncle Larry
My memories of my Uncle Larry are filled with joy and wonder.
I fondly remember playing penny poker with Uncle at Fishlake in grandpa’s cabin.
He would often let me win and then pretend to growl and then pout while he threatened to “Cross me off of the Christmas list.”
At first, I thought he was serious because of his gruff response. I was terrified, knowing that to be kicked off of the Christmas list meant that I would miss whatever treasure Aunt Renee had picked out especially for me.
When the pout found its way to my face, he would giggle and say, “Go ahead, kid, I’m just teasing you.” The room erupted in giggles, and the game resumed.
Uncle Larry was always a hoot at the Thanksgiving dinner table. Many a finger almost got stabbed when fighting over the turkey hearts or the last of grandmas rolls.
Sometimes Uncle would steal something from my plate, or put something I didn’t like to eat on it when I wasn’t looking. Then he would make up some story about, “why did you put it on your plate if you weren’t going to eat it.” Or “you ate that already.”
He loved to tease me, and I learned to love his teasing.
He loved my pies, and over the last little while, he was thrilled when I brought him barbeque ribs or bacon, and he scolded me when I didn’t.
Uncle Larry was always the hero in my corner.
He never failed to praise me for my political efforts and said, “You should have been mayor.” More often than I can count.   I was glad that he was proud of me, and I am grateful that he encouraged me in every aspect of my life.
“Well, good for you.” Or “It serves you right” were often the phrases that accompanied his praise. I believe that everybody needs an Uncle Larry to be a cheerleader in their corner, and then a tease to keep them humble.
On Friday morning, I went to my freezer and took out some ribs. I felt prompted that I should make them for Uncle and intended to deliver them that night.
I didn’t know he was in a care center; I had just visited on Saturday and helped him to the kitchen. I could see he was feeling bad, but denial is the mask we wear when we can not process the truth.
The ribs went back in the fridge when I got the call of his passing, and my heart skipped a beat, knowing that it will be a while before we can share good food and happy memories again.
I am happy for his reunion on the other side, and I am genuinely grateful that he is free from pain and suffering. My heart will go on, but a piece of it is missing.
Until we meet again, we will look for little kids to “cross off of the Christmas list.” Teenagers to “Steal food from.” And adults who “need encouragement.”
I love him with all of my heart, and I am forever grateful that I am one of the lucky ones who got to call him Uncle.
Love You Always and Forever, Michelle', null);

insert into posts(title, content, img) values('December 12, 2019', 'We moved to California from sleepy Herriman when I was thirteen years old.

My first day looked like every teenage nightmare. I arrived on my first day of High School, dressed in sensible shoes and a polyester pinstripe pantsuit, which boxed over a metal back brace that protected my broken back (a trampoline injury that occurred two weeks before we moved). Too much makeup, I wore my hair curled to the extreme in hopes of avoiding the obvious.

I was delivered to the school in a red ¾ ton paneled cattle truck, that my mom drove like a corvette, rounding the corners on two wheels.

I’m pretty sure that it wasn’t the hidden brace that my classmates were staring at, but rather my attire and my classy ride.

They dressed in high rise jeans that belled at the ankle, loud shirts with oversized collars, and thick heeled knee-high boots.

My Utah attire was lacking any resemblance to the norm, but I had bigger things to consume my worry.

Thrown into a High School environment (9th Grade was Jr. High in Utah), I was ill-equipped for the riggers of Freshman English.

 Mr. Peters English class was well on the way to completing the terms paper with only two weeks remaining to complete the final draft. The majority of the semester’s grade rested on the successful submission of many months of hard work.

Then to my dismay, I discovered that some of my Jr. High Credits were not transferable to this California High School curriculum.

New at school, no friends, uncool clothes, cattle truck for a ride, behind on my credits, I was a mess!

I’ll never forget the encouragement extended to me by Mr. Peters.

He said, “We’ve been working on this assignment all semester. I know it will be hard, but I need you to do what you can. I won’t require a rough draft, but you need to know that your final draft will determine your grade. Write what you know. You can do this.”

I went home and ditched the polyester in exchange for my grandfather’s pinstripe (apparently I had a thing for pinstripe) overalls that I buttoned with only one shoulder strap. I left the other strap hanging, choosing to wear my brace over my blouse instead of under my clothing. If I was going to look like a box, I needed to justify the reason.

I tamed the curls in my hair, and throttled back on the makeup, opting for a more natural look that enhanced my eyes without screaming ocean blue.

Wearing a more approachable look invited people to at least say hi, when we passed in the halls, and now the cattle truck ride fit my attire.

For the next two weeks, I spent every afternoon in the library, researching the facts and history of the American Quarter Horse.

Having grown up with these magnificent creatures, I was surprised to learn that I didn’t know everything about them.

I took careful footnotes of each newly discovered detail, making sure that my 3X5 cards were legible and correctly annotated.

Then I wrote what I knew — sharing the heart of my favorite creature, creating a canvas of knowledge and respect for the reader to absorb.

I remember feeling like I was delivering a child on the day of submission. I had poured my heart and soul into the process, desperately seeking the acceptance of my work.

It took about a week for Mr. Peter’s to finish his review of the class submissions.

He delivered each paper face down on the writer’s desk. Offering a smile as he walked down the isle of panicked teenagers.

I nearly fell off my chair when I turned my term paper over.

Marked in teacher red was the first and only A+ grade I have ever received.

Pretty sure a tear slipped from my teen worn eyes.

My love of writing emerged at that moment in time. 

Mr. Peters did more for me than he will ever know.  At a time when I sought the excuse for failure, he encouraged me to dig deep, permitting me to excel under the harsh reality of teen angst.

My gratitude is long overdue!

Thank you, Dan Peters, for believing in me.', null);

While serving on the Herriman City Council, we participated in Fire School 101. An invitation from Firefighters to elected officials with the intent to open our eyes to the challenges and costs of saving lives. Upon our arrival, fire professionals led us to a room where we were assigned turnout gear, which included at least fifty pounds of personal protective equipment.

My first sensation was claustrophobic. I felt trapped in the weight of the Bunker coat and pants, and I was terrified of the apparatus that pumped oxygen and protected my face. Fight or flight was screaming in my head. I had to take a few deep breaths before I could cover my face with the balaclava shroud and then don the helmet and oxygen mask.

The sensation of someone talking in your ear came as quite a surprise. I wasn’t expecting the communication device that shared commands and warnings and I felt like someone was invading my personal space.

Holding the fire hose was impossible without three or four people behind you. I found myself on my backside more than once.

I recall the intensity of the heat as we battled a trailer fire, and was surprised that we didn’t melt.

Climbing the ladder to a second-story window was both exhausting and terrifying. Hauling my overweight frame would have been enough without the addition of fifty extra pounds. I wondered how a firefighter could carry themselves, let alone a person they were rescuing.

I was doing ok until I reached the top. Panic consumed me as I realized I had to descend. My commander talked me down, advising that I keep my eye on the rungs of the ladder instead of the ground.

Then there were the jaws of life. Staged in the training compound was a car that had participated in a terrible crash.

Our commander schooled us on the import of finding a purchase point, stating that the equipment required such access to perform an extrication quickly.

Overcome by the gravity of the situation, I found myself considering the cost of extricating my soul from the things that trap me.

I had often struggled with the recognition of my sins and the reality claimed by confession. It hurt, and I was not always prepared to make the sacrifice to open the door to heaven.

I had never considered that remorse might be the purchase point that welcomed the eternal jaws of life offered by my Savior.

Tears flowed freely beneath my helmet, adding to the salty resolve to be better, to do better.

If my Savior had given His life to save mine, surely I could offer a purchase point into my heart and soul.

I am grateful for first-responders and the sacrifices they make to save us from danger. To each of you, I offer my gratitude.

To my Savior, I offer my heart and an open purchase point to my soul. I cannot comprehend Your sacrifice any more than I can do the job of our first-responders, but I can prepare a place for You to dwell, and I can proclaim the miracle of the purchase point that You so freely gave.', image);

There have been at least two times in my life when I have penned letters of righteous indignation.

Assured of my right to do so, I crafted brilliant manifesto’s calling malicious offenders to repentance.

Punctuated by hot tears that spilled ferociously onto the page, I fought the battle of deceit and betrayal. With every stroke of the keypad, I cited the offense.

I railed in defense of maligned characters of the innocent, citing the brutal disregard for truth in favor of gain. Words, prosecuting the offenders with tactical analysis, I proved my point.

Never had I experienced a greater need for justice — mercy, ungiven.

Outlining the facts of my case, a flood of anger washed over me. If my judgment was clear then why was I dwelling in grief?

I sought the counsel of friends, requiring them to sit through my reading of a diatribe meant for indicting.

The facts were clear, the offense real. My friends could not deny the truth of my outrage, annoyance, a common bond.

“We agree with everything,” they said. “But are you sure you want to send that?”

I stuffed the envelopes, addressing the rascals with a flourish of penmanship, a stamp, unavailable, I set it aside.  

Bothered by the darkness that dwelt in my heart, I prayed for guidance.

An immediate whisper brought light to my soul. “Be Still.” The response from heaven, never more exact.  

 I waited to post my letters, never sending them after all.  In each case, justice served. For me and my resentment, forgiveness granted.', null);

My father’s prized stallion, Robin Colty sired the two-year-old quarter horse filly named Timid Kate, her sorrel bearing a match for his crimson red.
I remember the day we met as if it was yesterday. That’s saying something since I’m now in my sexy sixties.
Shortly before my twelfth birthday, while working in our yard, my father asked me to follow him.
I thought we were going to change the headgates in the irrigation ditch. Daddy was silent but quickened his pace heading away from the ditch. Determination and excitement claimed his stride, and I had to run to keep up. We passed the ditch and headed South.

I looked at him with enough curiosity to summon an explanation.
“Let’s take a walk.” He said as we rounded the block. By now, my feet were keeping time with the beat of my heart. A walk with dad was always an adventure.
Unprepared for the scene that played ahead, beauty stole my breath and captured my view.
Standing in a field of green framed by whitewashed rail, I could see two elegant mares and two playful fillies. They danced about, sprinting and sparing, enjoying the fixed attention of our captured souls.

Dad stopped at the fence as we watched the spirited frolic. I could see mischief teasing at the corner of his brow as we examined God’s creations at play. It was at least ten minutes before he spoke again.
“Choose,” he said.
“Choose what?” my response.
“Choose your birthday present.” Daddy grinned beneath deep-set eyes that danced with merriment.

I couldn’t believe my ears. “A filly?” I choked out between happy tears.
“A Filly,” He said, with all the joy a giver can possess.
A grateful hug was my offer, along with a promise to care for her needs.

Kate stayed at J Bryant Miller’s Ranch for another month or so, and then we took another walk.
This time, I held a halter in my hands and a grin on my face that refused to fade away.

It took some time for Kate to like me. I worked with her until she trusted my friendship.
Kate was anything but timid, full of spirit, and drive. She taught me that horses possess ambition and desire for a competitive edge. She was fast and preferred to live life in that gear.
At first, I was merely a passenger holding on for dear life. Daily rides, oats, and carrots helped seal the bond that permitted me to become one with her nature. Before long, we were off on adventures that took us to the South Hills and through High Country scrub oak.
She ignored my rendition of “America the Beautiful,” as I sang at the top of my lungs, referring to the miles of mountains and wheat that were my back yard. Or at least the backyard of my neighbors who forgave the trespass of respectful youth.
I ignored her occasional sprints through scrub oak, which propelled us up and over the foliage rather than through the strafing brush.

We competed in cloverleaf barrels, pole bending, keyhole, egg marathon, musical tires, and western equestrian. Earning trophies and ribbons in team and individual events as members of the Riverton Rough Riders, Junior division.
Of all the exciting possibilities, Musical Tires being Kate’s favorite competition.
Old tires, thrown about an arena in a circular shape, became the object of our challenge.
Much like musical chairs, when the music stopped, a tire had to be claimed. With each new round, a tire or two removed. The last person to stand in a tire won the game.
Racing clockwise riders were dependant upon speed and control. The rules kept the horde in continual motion, reverse a disqualifying factor.
Did I forget to say, “Claiming a tire, required the rider to dismount while the horse was in motion.”

We practiced over and over, and on the day of the competition, we were ready.
I could feel the quiver through Kate’s muscles as she anticipated the sport. When the music began, we were off like a dirty shirt, racing to hold rank in a crowded field of hormonal teenagers.
Rounds of elimination included bumped bottoms and bruised egos. I was in for the win, and Kate invested in our purpose. Two competitors remained, and one of them was my beautiful horse and me. I could feel victory within our grasp.
As we rounded the last corner, we were going so fast that we both passed the tire when the music stopped. Backtracking was an automatic loss, so we gained momentum racing full throttle to the round of completion.

Kate in the lead, I held on, knowing she might easily pass the tire, and before she could round again, I hollered “Whoa Girl!”
She stopped on a dime. I did not! Over her head and into a pile of stuff you don’t talk about in church, I fell. Missing the tire completely, I captured the taunts and stares of the competition, who seemed to be pointing, “Loser” fingers in my direction. Sitting on the bleachers, I noticed my crush, looking at me like I was a creature from the black lagoon.
It was only then that I realized my teeth were full of horse doings, my beautiful blonde locks stuck to my head with a squishy green hue that dripped over one eye.
I stood there, humiliated. My preteen-self wondering if I would ever compete again.

In the middle of my angst, I felt a nudge at my back.
At first, I thought it was a judge prodding me to leave the arena. When I realized it was Kate, tears washed over my face, tracing the dung and clearing a path for gratitude.

If embarrassment was our reward, she was in for the ride. I pinned our second place ribbon on her bridle, knowing she would forever hold a first-place standing in my heart.

The lessons I learned on the back of a horse are immeasurable. God’s creations, in all of their forms, are intended to bring love and joy to life. Overcoming life’s trials with a horse by your side is a great blessing indeed.

I loved that horse with all of my heart, but more than that, I love the father who sacrificed time and resources for a young girl’s dreams.', null);
